title: Enums
cover: "@/assets/course/pb138/course-cover.webp"
description: In this lecture, we'll delve into the concept of enums (enumerations) in Rust. Enums are a powerful feature that allows you to define custom types with a finite set of possible values. We'll explore how to declare and use enums, creating them to represent various states, options, or choices in your programs. With practical examples, you'll see how enums can enhance code readability and make it more robust by providing a structured way to handle different cases. By the end of this lecture, you'll have a solid grasp of how to leverage enums effectively in Rust for better program organization and control flow.
